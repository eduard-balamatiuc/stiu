## 🚀 The Problem

Being a teacher is challenging, especially at the university level. Research shows that teachers spend only 46% of their time actually teaching, with the rest dedicated to:

- Grading and providing feedback (5 hours)
- Planning and preparing materials (5 hours)
- Administrative work (3 hours)
- Non-teaching student interaction (3 hours)
- Other critical activities (8 hours)

Moodle's complex interface complicates this workload further. According to European research, 91% of teachers report increased workload due to the digitalization of course materials.

Many teachers struggle with:
- Creating and updating course materials each semester
- Dealing with student copying of answers from previous years
- Navigating Moodle's unintuitive interface and hidden options
- Managing question banks and quiz creation
- Time-consuming grading processes
